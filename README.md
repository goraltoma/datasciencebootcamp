Text-based communication has become one of the most common forms of expression. We email, text message, tweet, and update our statuses on a daily basis. As a result, unstructured text data has become extremely common, and analyzing large quantities of text data is now a key way to understand what people are thinking.

Tweets on Twitter help us find trending news topics in the world. Reviews on Amazon help users purchase the best-rated products. These examples of organizing and structuring knowledge represent Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

NLP is a field of computer science that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans. NLP techniques are used to analyze text, providing a way for computers to understand human language. A few examples of NLP applications include automatic summarization, topic segmentation, and sentiment analysis.


The goal of this project is to predict sentiment for the given Twitter post using Python. Sentiment analysis can predict many different emotions attached to the text.

Sentiment Analysis: the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. Itâ€™s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.

In this project only 2 major are considered: positive and negative. The training dataset is small, 10000 examples (5000 for each group).
